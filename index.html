                <p>
                    Born in Taipei, Taiwan. My family immigrated to the United States when I was six-years-old. 
                    I furthered my Chinese language skills through self-learning and eventually became a Chinese linguist in the US Army
                    and eventually rose to the position of expert Chinese linguist.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Seeking a new challenge, I decided to learn a completely different language: computer coding. It is my hope that
                    I can become fluent in this language as well and earn the bragging right of being able to communicate with man and machine.
